## Upgrading from Yap 1.x to Yap 2.x

---


Follow the upgrade steps as you normally do above.  You will also need to follow item #3 & #4 under [Setup](#setup), to add the Twilio credentials.

You can check that everything is functioning by going to the upgrade advisor http://your-instance/upgrade-advisor.php
